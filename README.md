# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for an algorithms project? Use this repository. Make sure
to explain what problem you're solving and how you're doing it.

# Problem Specification
I am going to create a function or a set of functions that generate a connected graph with a number of edges between the number of nodes and twice the number of nodes. This will be useful for generating test cases for my graph problems. Afterwards, I will do a recurrence analysis on this. Not sure how I will write test code for this, if at all.

# Response
